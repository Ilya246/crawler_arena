# crawler_arena

This is a mindustry gamemode plugin for the crawler arena gamemode - players will fight off waves of crawlers. Before using, take note that the enemies have no pathfinding and will only go to players in a straight line, so use a flat open map, preferably without deepwater. Also make sure that the middle of the map and map edges are unobstructed for enemies and players to spawn. If there's any issues with the plugin, try doing `rules add canGameOver false` and `rules add unitCap 100`.
